A Simple system to emulate the SRB2 master server with a static webpage. 
SRB2 seems to check if an ip is online so any servers that are offline don't get shown. 
I got the list for a bunch of ips from tech and downloaded the master server list one day for some others. 
feel free to pull request to add to this i guess
